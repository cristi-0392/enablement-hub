<h1>Create a new browser profile (Microsoft Edge)</h1>
It's always good to have a separate browser profile for your work and for workshops like this. This way you can keep all of your credentials separate and not have to worry about logging out of your personal / work accounts. In the example we will be using Microsoft Edge, <b>instead you can also use any other Browser, just make sure to use a profile where you are not logged in with any other Microsoft Account!</b>

<h2>Create new profile</h2>

1. Open Microsoft Edge

2. Click on the profile icon (picture) on the top right corner

3. Hover over **Other profiles** and then select select **Set up a new work or school profile**

This will then open up a new browser window on your taskbar.

4. Right click the Edge icon on your task bar and select Pin that browser window to your taskbar
